# 🚀 ExoKeplerAlly

ExoKeplerAlly is an innovative AI-powered web application designed to classify exoplanet candidates efficiently. By analyzing datasets and processing planetary attributes through a neural network, it determines whether a candidate is a **confirmed exoplanet** or a **false positive**. This tool saves time and resources, allowing astronomers and enthusiasts to focus on studying confirmed exoplanets, understanding their physics, or searching for Earth-like planets in the quest for life beyond our solar system.

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Data Analysis**: The system processes stellar and planetary attributes from datasets.
2. **Neural Network Classification**: The attributes are fed into a custom neural network model trained to detect exoplanets.
3. **Candidate Classification**:
   - **Confirmed Exoplanet** ✅
   - **False Positive** ❌
4. **Result Application**: Enables prioritization of promising candidates for further study.
